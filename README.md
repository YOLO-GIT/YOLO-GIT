### Hey folks and pepol! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sufi, but feel free to call me YOLO-GIT if you fancy. I'm an intermediate software developer who loves creating a variety of things, from web applications to mobile apps. There might even be an API in the cards for the futureâ€”I'm keeping my options open! While I'm not quite at the expert level just yet, who knows, I might get there someday.
